To finish up our semester we were given a clean brief with a made-up client where we were tasked with taking the project from start to finish with design, HTML and CSS.

## Description

The client, broken down:
- <strong>Community Science Museum:</strong> An interactive science museum.
- <strong>Target audience:</strong> Primary and middle school children.

The project brief, broken down:
- Design and build a modern, accessible, and responsive website.
- Use the provided images and text content.
- Ensure the website appeals to children without being patronising.
- A logo has not been supplied; you are free to create a placeholder logo.
- Frameworks are not permitted.
- JavaScript is not permitted for this assignment.

User stories to guide the design:
- A visitor can view a home page showing key information and impactful imagery.
- A visitor can view a contact page showing the museum's address, phone number, opening hours and contact form.
- A visitor can view a contribution showing information on how to contribute to the museum.
- A visitor can view an exhibition showing upcoming events and available exhibitions.
- A visitor can view a privacy policy page showing the museum's privacy policy.
- A visitor can view a terms and conditions page showing the museum's terms and conditions.

The goal of this project was to evaluate our progress, ensuring we had a comprehensive understanding of our studies so far and identifying any skills that might need further refinement before the second semester.
